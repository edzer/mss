agree on a set of classes (OWL?)

synchronize R class names with those in the OWL pattern

take care of time, space, spacetime;

take care of trajectories -- what if they measure ambient air
temperature? -> coerce to ST Geostatistical variable?

coercion ppp <--> PointPatternDataFrame

document exported classes

do all classes need ObservationWindows? (geost, lattice: no?)

## TODOs
* verify that SpatialPixel objects do not have anyDuplicated(x@grid.index), for domain, or sp
* think functional support through: is it needed? How does it link to predict.gstat?
* grid cells: (i) constant value in grid cells: support = "point";
(ii) single value for aggregate of grid cell: support = "feature";
(iii) single value only valid for grid cell centre: object needs
to be coercer to SpatialPoints and support = "point"
* check whether multiple polygons work!
* check whether observations match domain

## functional support
```{r}
f4x4 = function(size) {
	grd = size * expand.grid(x = c(-3, -1, 1, 3), y = c(-3, -1, 1, 3)) / 8
	n = nrow(grd)
	function(x = 0, y = 0) as.matrix(cbind(rep(x,n),rep(y,n)) + grd)
}
f = f4x4(2)
f() # centered at (0,0)
f(10,5) # centered at (10,5)
```
