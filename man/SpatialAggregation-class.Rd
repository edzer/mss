\description{
SpatialAggregation: a Class for Spatial Aggregations (Area data)
}
\details{
A class to store spatial aggregations, such as population densities or grid maps;
spatial aggregations are (single) values that have reference to an area, e.g.
the maximum, average, or sum over an area.

Aggregation values are values that refer to an area (polygon, grid cell), or line,
as a whole: the values cannot be interpreted as the value at any given point in
an area or on a line; these individual values may be recovered by estimation
(area-to-point interpolation), but in principle got lost by aggregation. Aggregation
may be integral to observation (e.g., remote sensing pixels refer to values aggregated
over an area similar to the pixel), or a result from spatially aggregating data,
e.g. from using \link{aggregate}.
}
\note{
The domain for spatial aggregations is identical to the geometry covered by its geometry. The support of the aggregation is identical to its features (grid cells/pixels, polygons).
